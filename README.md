Project Name - Psychological Stress Classification Using Natural Language Processing & Deep Learning.

Project Members - Abhay Puri & Sara Besharati

## Dataset
The data is present in the [data folder](https://github.com/abhaypuri/Comp_599_Project/tree/main/data).

## Code 
We have provided 5 parts for our work and most of the code is in the .ipynb and it can be run on either google colab or kaggle.

1. We reproduced the results of "Dreaddit: A Reddit Dataset for Stress Analysis in Social Media by E.Turcan, K.McKeown (2019)" paper
